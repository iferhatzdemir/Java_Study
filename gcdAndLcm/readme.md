## FINDING GCD-LCM
#### This repo contains examples to reinforce the Java loops topic.

--- 

#### Details
* In this repository
    * One README.md file
    * MainOne.java file where programs that find GCD-LCM are written with for loop
    * MainTwo.java file where programs that find GCD-LCM are written with while loop

**WHAT IS GCD-LCM?

>*GCD :* The greatest common divisor of two or more natural numbers is called the greatest common divisor of these numbers, GCD for short.
>
> EXAMPLE: Let's find the greatest common divisor of 18 and 24 step by step.

Divisors of >18 : 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18

Divisors of >24 : 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24

>The largest of these common divisors is the GCD of 6.
**ECOK :* The smallest common multiple of two or more natural numbers is called the smallest common multiple of these numbers, in short, ECOK.

> EXAMPLE: Let's find the least common multiple of 6 and 8 step by step.

Multiples of >6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, ...

Multiples of >8: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, ...

>The smallest of these common multiples is the LCM of 24.
>LCM = (n1*n2) / GCD
