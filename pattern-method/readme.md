# Number Pattern
### This program prints numbers according to a set rule.

---
### Details
* The Rule:

    * Subtract 5 from the number until the number received from the
      user is negative or 0.
    * Then add 5 again and prints the number on the terminal until
      the entered number.
    * Use the recursive method.

**For example:**
> number:16
>
> 16  11 6 1 -4 1 6 11 16
