### Details
If two numbers are equal to the sum of their divisors excluding themselves, these numbers are called friends.

Example: 220 and 284

>220 : 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110 = 284 284 : 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220 In 1636, Fermat discovered that 17296 and 18416 were friends.Descartes discovered the third pair.Leonhard Euler compiled a list of 62 pairs, including 59 pairs he had found.In 1866, 16-year-old Italian Nicolo Paganini showed that the numbers 1184 and 1210 were also such a pair.
